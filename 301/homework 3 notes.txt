On android, java.awt and java.swing packages do not exist, so they will need to be replaced by corresponding Android supported packages.
10 different classes which have the AWT problem in the maze codebase, 8 of which need to be adjusted


Homework 6 - we are not at this point cutting off reliability on the AWT package/objects. We are taking a look at all classes 3-10 in the outline, seeing what AWT methods they rely on, and creating corresponding methods in the mazePanel class to feed to them.

For some classes, look at their methods(like RangeSet) it may be possible to make things easier by simple rewriting. Remeber the use of an array done in class!

Go through each of the 8 classes, see what AWT/swing methods each relies on and write it down. 
Create a corresponding feeder method in the MazePanel Class
Eliminate AWT reliance in these classes by removing their import statements, and make their methods call MazePanel.newmethod() instead.

Test the java application to see if it still works as normal.
